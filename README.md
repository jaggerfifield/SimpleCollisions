Collisions in SDL

I didn't want to (or know how to) include SDL files here and apply the proper lisence.
So you will need to aquire those on your own, here are some links to help.

# Depends on:
SDL2		http://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
SDL2_image	http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/

# Some more help
You will extract both SDL files into the folder with code.c
Next you need to grab the binary files from the bin folder (in SDL)
	SDL2.dll
	SDL2_image.dll
	libpng16-16.dll
and place them beside code.c (or the executible that will compile)
Now if everything works right just run 'make' and cross your fingers.
